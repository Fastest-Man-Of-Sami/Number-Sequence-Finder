# Number-Sequence-Finder
This is a finder using information entropy greedy algorithm in the following problem:

One is tasked to find out a random n-digit sequence consisting of 1-n. Each time you are given how good your guess is, i.e. you are given the digits that you get them right. Your guesses may not consist of repeating numbers, either.

The code is pretty bad in efficiency, and my estimation on its complexity is around O((n!)^2 ln(n!)).
